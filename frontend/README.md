### Start the development Process

To start the frontend development we first need to starte the react development server

```
npm run start
```

In a secnnod termial we need to activate tailwind watch to update the input css while development 2.

```
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./src/css/output.css --watch
```

In vs code you can activate the watch to automaticly recompile all tsx files after saving

you can do this by pressing strg + shift + b and select to watch the tsconfig
